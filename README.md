###  OpenFunction | Kubernetes ‚ò∏Ô∏è
OpenFunction is a cloud-native open source FaaS (Function as a Service) platform aiming to let you focus on your business logic without having to maintain the underlying runtime environment and infrastructure. You only need to submit business-related source code in the form of functions.


üß± Key Features:
```
‚úÖ Cloud agnostic and decoupled with cloud providers' BaaS
‚úÖ Pluggable architecture that allows multiple function runtimes
‚úÖ Support both sync and async functions
‚úÖ Unique async functions support that can consume events directly from event sources
‚úÖ Support generating OCI-Compliant container images directly from function source code.
‚úÖ Flexible autoscaling between 0 and N
‚úÖ Advanced async function autoscaling based on event sources' specific metrics
‚úÖ Simplified BaaS integration for both sync and async functions by introducing Dapr
‚úÖ Advanced function ingress & traffic management powered by K8s Gateway API
‚úÖ Flexible and easy-to-use events management framework
```
